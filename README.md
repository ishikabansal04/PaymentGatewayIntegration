#Tech Stack:

#Short description:
The project provides an option of donation which has three payment options :Paypal, Credit Card and Internet Banking. Clicking on donate lands the user on payment
page which asks the user for filling up the credit card details and the mailing details of the user in order to receive the confirmation email of donation.
Oce the details are filled and form is submitted we land on to a success page(as a confirmation that payment was successful) and also provides an option of checking out
invoice/ payment confirmation receipt. In case the mailing details were not correct , then the user lands upto a 404 error page which means transaction didnt occur and you
must fill the form again. After all steps are done correctly, check you inbox for the confirmation email which also displays the amount of transaction. If not found in inbox, 
please check in spam box as too many mails cause the email to fall under spam.
